Project Overview
--------------------
I have put this off for too long. It's painful to think how many
revisions of my dot-files I've wasted by not doing a better job at
keeping track of them throughout the years. The main motivation for
creating this repository today is for my emacs files. I seem to have
wildly different config files at work vs. at home. No more.

Features Files
--------------------
1. emacs files
   + .emacs - Main configuration file.
   + .emacs.d/* - Modular inclusion of various modules.

Closing Thoughts
--------------------
None, yet.
