Project Overview
--------------------
I have put this off for too long. It's painful to think how many
revisions of my dot-files I've wasted by not doing a better job at
keeping track of them throughout the years. The main motivation for
creating this repository today is for my emacs files. I seem to have
wildly different config files at work vs. at home. No more.

Features Files
--------------------
1. emacs files
   + .emacs - Main configuration file.
   + .emacs.d/* - Modular inclusion of various modules.

Installing
--------------------
1. Checkout the repository to a temporary location
   git clone git@github.com:jonEbird/dotfiles.git /tmp/dotfiles
2. Copy all of the contents into your home directory \\
   With the "--backup --suffix=.orig" options, files being overridden are backed up with a .orig extension.
   #+begin_src shell
   rsync -avn --backup --suffix=.orig /tmp/dotfiles/ ~/
   #+end_src
3. Verify
   #+begin_src shell
   cd; git status
   #+end_src

Closing Thoughts
--------------------
None, yet.
